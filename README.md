# Deep Learning Projects
This repository contains some personal projects that I have undertaken
to learn more about deep learning with python. The majority of the
projects will use a combination of sci kit learn and keras with
tensorflow as a backend. The majority of the projects are based on
tutorials and blog posts on Jason Brownlee's website http://machinelearningmastery.com/.
