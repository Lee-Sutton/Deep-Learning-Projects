# Deep Learning Projects
This repository contains some personal projects that I have undertaken
to learn more about deep learning with python. The majority of the
projects will use a combination of sci kit learn and keras with
tensorflow as a backend. The majority of the projects are based on
tutorials and blog posts on Jason Brownlee's website http://machinelearningmastery.com/.

## Sciprog Tutorials
I will be going over Keras for deep learning. Based on how much time we have in the tutorial I will be going over how to build feed forward neural networks and convolution neural networks.

## Multilayer Perceptrons Notebook
In this section I explore a number of different datasets using feed forward neural networks. These datasets include: 

- The iris dataset http://scikit-learn.org/stable/auto_examples/datasets/plot_iris_dataset.html

- Binary Classification Of Sonar Returns https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/undocumented/connectionist-bench/sonar/sonar.all-data

- Boston housing regression problem https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Housing

## MNIST Handwriting recognition notebook
In this notebook I examine the MNIST dataset with a feed forward neural network and then a convolution neural network. More information on the dataset can be found here https://www.tensorflow.org/versions/r0.10/tutorials/mnist/beginners/
